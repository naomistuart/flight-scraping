# :airplane: flight-scraping
The goal of this project is to build a web application to scrap Sydney Airport's [flight listing pages](https://www.sydneyairport.com.au/flights/), and to display all of today's flights in a single HTML page.

## Background
Sydney Airport's [flight listing page](https://www.sydneyairport.com.au/flights/) enables a user to choose between Arrivals or Departures, and between Domestic or International flights. However, this is no option to display all flights on a single page. For plane spotting purposes, it would be helpful to have a complete listing of the current day's flights in a single place.


## Features of the completed web app
1. Dynamic loading screen while data is fetched
2. Results page displays complete listing of today's flights at Sydney Airport. Icons are used to differentiate between arrivals and departures, and between domestic and international flights
3. Web application is [deployed to heroku](https://sydneyflights.herokuapp.com/)


## Built with
- [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - Python library used to scrap HTML pages
- [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started) - used to automate Chrome browser interaction from Python
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/) - Python framework used to build the web application


## Method
A brief description of the steps used to create the web app:

### 1. Web scraping
- Use Selenium Chromedriver to grab HTML content from Sydney Airport's flight listing page. There are four possible combinations of domestic / international and arrival / departures, so there are four HTML pages to grab
- Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and pull out relevant information. For each flight, relevant info includes its origin / destination, stopover (if any), airline, flight number, status (arrived, departed, delayed, cancelled etc.), scheduled time, and estimated time
- Store parsed data in a Pandas dataframe. Each row corresponds to a single flight today.

### 2. Build Flask app
- Create Flask app with two routes - one for loading screen while waiting for data to be fetched, and one to display the results table
- Use CSS templates to style the loading and result pages.

### 3. Deploy to Heroku
- Define a `Procfile` to declare the command to be executed to start the app. [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) is used as the web server.
- Define a `requirements.txt` to specify the Python package dependencies on Heroku via pip
- Create a new Heroku app and deploy by connecting to GitHub repository.


## How to use

### Local use
Navigate to project root directory and run the following commands:
```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python main.py
```
Open localhost `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You should see the webpage rendered.

### On the web
Go to [https://sydneyflights.herokuapp.com/](https://sydneyflights.herokuapp.com/)  
Note the loading gif will play for around 20 seconds while the data is fetched.

## Tricky bits and challenges
### Scraping dynamic HTML pages
- Initially attempted to simply use the `get()` function from Python's `requests` library to grab HTML content from Sydney Airport's flight listing page
- This did not work - close examination of the scraped content showed that not all HTML from the web page was fetched. Specifically, the scraped content was missing the HTML tables for the individual flight listings
- This is because the airport's flight listings are not static HTML pages - rather the content is dynamically generated by JavaScript
- As a result, `webdriver.chrome()` from the `Selenium` library was needed to perform dynamic scraping.
 
### Truncated content in dataframe
- When using `pandas.DataFrame.to_html` to render the flights dataframe as an HTML table, some of the content (specifically URLs for the airline logos) was truncated.
- This resulted in the airline logos not displaying correctly in the table
- Interestingly, this issue only materialised when rendering the HTML table on a browser. There was no issue when rendering an identical table in Jupyter Notebook
- `pd.options.display.max_colwidth = 200` was used to adjust the display settings of the dataframe, and successfully fixed the issue.

### Running Chrome Driver on Heroku
- Configuring Chrome Driver to work on Heroku was challenging
- Chrome Driver was downloaded as an `.exe` file - this worked fine while testing locally, but posed problems when attempting to deploy to Heroku
- Successful solution, based on Andres Sevilla's [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ven-pqwk3ec&fbclid=IwAR2zpRZK8rdvqgzsOPcwMZMzpp8N-hE6YlMcW-mQivaxy2u7iXmwCDe-Mcw):  
**1. Initialise instance of Chrome Driver:**
    ```python
    from selenium import webdriver
    import os

    chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
    chrome_options.binary_location = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CHROME_BIN")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=os.environ.get("CHROMEDRIVER_PATH"), chrome_options=chrome_options)
    ```

    **2. Add the following buildpacks to the Heroku app:**
    - [https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-google-chrome](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-google-chrome)
    - [https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-chromedriver](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-chromedriver)
    
    Note: Buildpacks can be easily added by going to the **Settings** tab of the app on Heroku

    **3. Add the following config vars to the Heroku app:**
    - `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH = /app/.chromedriver/bin/chromedriver`
    - `GOOGLE_CHROME_BIN = /app/.apt/usr/bin/google-chrome`
    
    Note: Config vars can be easily edited by going to the **Settings** tab of the app on Heroku


### Heroku memory quotas
- Currently, the Heroku app often fails to return a complete flight listing, instead returning only a partial listing
- This is because Heroku has [memory restrictions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/limits) (500 MB per application), and exceeding this causes a "Memory quota exceeded" error
- Future work for this project will implement a Postgres database to store recent flight information, so the Sydney Airport website does not have to be scrapped every time a user opens the Heroku app. This will improve load times and work around the memory quota issue.
